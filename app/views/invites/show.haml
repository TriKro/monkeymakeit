      Want the whole book for free?

    %p
      Invite some friends. I'll give a
      %b signed first edition print
      of "#{@invite.story.title}" to the top 50 inviters.

    %p
      I'll get this book published and printed once we hit
      %span.black 5000
      %span.red> *
      &#32;readers (We're at
      = @invite.story.subscribers.count
      now.)
    %p{ :style => "color: #888; font-size: 14px;" }
      %span.red> *
      Why 5000? That's the number of readers a major publisher needs before signing new authors.
