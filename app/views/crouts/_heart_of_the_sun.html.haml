  n the year 2202, immortality is free, poverty and war are distant memories, everyone who wants to be is a full-time creator. And only the really spiritually committed choose to die.

  On Earth, artificial minds head the world’s power centers; human-speed thought is an anachronism; corporations are born, merge and conquer each other at billions per second. Scientific breakthroughs tear through paradigms daily. The Transhuman Technology Corporation, godlike, bestows upon humans the ultimate gift: physical immortality, with an ever-evolving range of increasingly sophisticated artificial bodies. The company’s free immersive entertainment programs, dismissed by their detractors as mere advertisements, are nevertheless among the most popular sentient media in the solar system. AI/Human symbiosis to the point where they are indistinguishable: humans upload their minds at will to software, and AI’s control posthuman bodies. Cultural prosperity reigns: everyone who wants to is a creator: shining age of artists, scientists, philosophers, intellectuals. The termination of a sentient mind, human or machine, is a crime of the highest order.

  SunOne: a living breathing space station, dancing a divine web around the Sun, a synergy of humans and spiritually presenced artificial intelligence. Genetic engineering of awesome dimension: bodies with built in DNA-level organic computational abilities distributed throughout; every cell a processing unit. SunOne’s citizens are all born into human bodies. As teenagers, they can choose whether to engage a 7 year cycle of spiritualized OneMetal bodymorphing, the gradual replacement of the human cells with powerful nanotech machinery, a process with special attention toward keeping intact the human body’s subtle energies. Physical immortality is easy, but SunOne denizen mostly choose to die, every 100 or 1000 years or so. They do so in order to return to spiritual worlds, the regenerative “sleep” between lifetimes. On Earth, the immortals look at SunOne as a pathological suicide cult, teaching its children to kill themselves.

  Against this backdrop, Miriam. An artist and warrior, 200 years old, creating a massive artwork to the sun, a final parting gift: the spiritual ritual of her own death. She’s close to the Sun, almost too close, meditating, weaving, stillness and awe, mathematical revelations blossoming like lotus petals around her goddess body...
