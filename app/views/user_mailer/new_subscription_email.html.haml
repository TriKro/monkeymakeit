    Hi,

%p
  Thanks! You're subscribed to "#{@story.title}"

%p
  I'll send you each draft chapter as it's written.

%p
  Want the whole book for free?

%p
  Invite some friends. I'll give a
  %b signed first edition print
  of "#{@story.title}" to the top 50 inviters.

%p
  I'll get this book published and printed once we hit 5000
  %span{ :style => 'color: #8a1f11' }> *
  &#32;readers (We're at
  = @story.subscribers.count
  now.)
%p{ :style => "color: #888; font-size: .9em;" }
  %span{ :style => 'color: #8a1f11' } *
  Why 5000? That's the number of readers a major publisher needs before signing new authors.
