The tip of one floppy pink foot was crushed and bleeding. O’Malley removed one of his black socks and wrapped the duck’s foot with it, and then he noticed its eyes. They were as red as bloody hell, and O’Malley looked into them, those eyes as red as bloody hell, and called the duck by its new name; he called the duck by the only name it could possibly have had, by the name of Doris. He whispered “Doris” and he looked into those bloody red eyes, and those bloody red eyes took him, took O’Malley in; into those bloody red eyes that looked back as if his own eyes looked back instead, as if instead of those eyes of Doris looking back all bloody and red and staring into O’Malley’s eyes just as he was staring into Doris’s eyes it was only one set of eyes falling into the other, and back into the first, like a video camera recording its own image, two minds staring at each other, each staring at the other, each staring at itself. Those eyes saw O’Malley, yes, he would swear it, those eyes, those bloody red eyes saw him, all of him, all facets and faces, the horror and the hope, all at once, as impossible as it seemed. Doris saw O’Malley, and O’Malley saw Doris, and that was the most truthful thing O’Malley had ever known.
