“I have to postpone,” said O’Malley, referring to their weekly meeting, and she responded with something about deliverables and expectations and scheduling challenges. O’Malley focused on her voice, oh so stimulating it was, like smoke and peaty fumes filling the spaces inside him. He pictured her naked; he couldn’t help it, nor did he want to, though he’d never seen her body. He pictured the face he’d seen during video conferences. He pictured the pinch of her upper lip, and the pink swell of the lower. They were lips like many others, but beauty is biological, and not a thing diminished by its own multiplicity. In a rare bout of workplace honesty, O’Malley interrupted Jane with his affections for Doris. 

“What?” said Jane.

“I know, she’s a beaut.” 

“It’s albino?” 

“And did you know,” said O’Malley, “Doris sleeps with only one brain hemisphere at a time? Evolutionarily speaking, her fear of predators is so strong she can sleep with one eye open and half her brain hanging out in waiting.” O’Malley had followed the Internet’s knowledge trail from Doris’s relatives to other studies on split brains, those conducted on epileptic patients who’d had their corpus callosum snipped to reduce the seizures, cutting the communication between the two brain halves, and O’Malley discovered what we all now know. When the left visual field (located in the right hemisphere) cannot communicate with the speech-control centers in the left hemisphere, patients couldn’t name what the right side of their brain was seeing, though they could pick it up and draw it with their left hand, and – perhaps akin to what was hidden behind Doris’s own soft quacks – these patients would confabulate explanations for their odd behavior since they couldn’t verbally access the real details in the left hemisphere. Sounds like science fiction, doesn’t it?
