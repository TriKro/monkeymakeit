“Confabulate,” said O’Malley to Jane and to Doris, ruffling her feathers to show that the word impressed her. One study said that patients would even show different personalities if they wrote versus spoke responses to questions. He lifted Doris to eye-level. She was calm, lit by the glow of his computer and the office’s fluorescent overheads. She might be awake, asleep, or both. Perhaps she had seen some horrors this morning that only came to her sleeping mind, or maybe she saw them when the side of her brain that could cope with them was sleeping and no longer inhibiting them. During those times, maybe there wasn’t only one Doris. Maybe there were two. O’Malley said as much to Jane, but she cut him off, and he imagined her pushing her brown bangs back with a puff from her mouth as she hung up. Some people just don’t know when to be impressed. Many months before, late at night, the two of them had spoken on the phone, and though Jane was probably too drunk to remember, she had confided in O’Malley that the type of love she was looking for was when two people look at each other and say to each other, “I can’t wait until you’re old, so that I can carry you around and clean your ass when you no longer can.” O’Malley never forgot that. Why did he want us to know this? Why did he include this in his final message to me? What import could he have assigned to such a statement in the wake of all he’d experienced? Remember this: companionship can come in strange forms, forms even now being invented and compiled from synthetic materials.
