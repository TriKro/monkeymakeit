Agitated, consumed, infatuated, O’Malley took Doris for a walk. When he became tired, he sat with Doris on a park bench by the piers so he could see the docks and the water and the sidewalks and the buildings of the city all at once. He tried to take it all in, but of course no one can ever take it all in at the same time, so when he couldn’t achieve absolute clarity of all senses at once, he tried instead for absolute clarity of each sense in succession, discerning each from each other. He smelled the fish in the boats. He saw the dark shimmer of the entrapped ocean. He felt the wind against his cheek and saw its evidence in the whooshing leaves, Doris’s fluttering feathers, the scowling pedestrians, and the plastic baggies occasionally lifted and swirled into the air. He heard passing voices, passing cars, and dogs both curious and irate. He tried fighting off each association as it arrived, and had some success, but he couldn’t say how long he should give each sense or when interruption by a new sense should yield the disappointment of failure, and so he gave up. He had Doris to protect, after all, so it is no surprise that his mind focused on the barking of dogs whenever they came close, assuredly smelling the oily meat beneath her tasteless feathers. The sharp barks became louder, closer, and he held Doris to his chest as he saw a pair of bear-like dogs tugging on their leashes as their owner struggled to keep them on the sidewalk.
