Partners, associates, and employees of O’Malley’s, before I continue, allow me a moment of praise. As his relatives gather for their own memorial, let us, his surrogate family, salute him here, together, and in doing so pay respects to a legacy that will take one great step forward tonight through the marvel of robotics. While it is true that a white coffin is a poor substitute for a man, O’Malley’s presence reminds us of why we’re here. In the years preceding the trolley story, O’Malley had made an indelible mark on our dear industry. Together, we had turned aboriginal instruments into children’s toys, and then linked the lack of such toys to the rise of modern autism. And that was in the early days. We are those who care about the hopes of our fellow humans. We care enough to make sure that their hopes are attainable, even uncovering the hopes of which they’re not yet aware. Who else can say that? So you ask yourself: Why would such a man live the remainder of his years as he did? Why would he abandon his real work, all his agency had built, in favor of this other thing, this eponymous Institute? And a non-profit no less! I may be the first to tell of the events following the trolley accident, but I assure you that he confided them to me only recently, in the fluorescent haze of his Institute’s board room. He was dying. The transfer of ownership was almost done, but we weren’t talking business. We weren’t talking at all. He sat across from me, sketching his story in number two lead, pausing only to stare out the window at the rain’s gathering puddles. Let me speak of him now as he might have spoken of himself in his more coherent years. Knowing O’Malley as I did, I’m sure I’ll get it right.
