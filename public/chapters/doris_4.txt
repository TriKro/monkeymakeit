Picture him looking outside the trolley window as he plugs his headphones into his ears. Imagine for a moment the strains of Irish crooners slipping into the somber backdrop of a cold coastal day, drowning out his fellow humans’ croaks and chirps. They seem selfish and bitter, some like scavengers, others just oblivious like the elephant who stomps unknowingly on the lizard’s tail. Are we even the same species?, he wonders, but they are only human – groggy and irritated and scared of not being good enough for their jobs, their wives, their friends, their families, and it is only in distance that we know to forgive them. Standing there, at once a part of humanity and isolated from them, is what O’Malley loved most, encouraging his sense of inflated importance. Please, do not take this statement as derisive. O’Malley’s was well-deserved, and for the hard-working sons of first-generation blue-collar immigrants, this was a prized and rare sensation. How far had he come from his parents and the roots and the earth? How far from these familiar notions that now draw the modern spirit back to the ideal of simpler times? Salute him, for look at us revering him now. Salute!
