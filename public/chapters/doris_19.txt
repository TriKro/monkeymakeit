Yes, I know what you’re all thinking, and let me assure you that I struggled with it too. More than anything, O’Malley wanted every man to have a Doris, every woman a Morris, and as a result of his pursuit we will redefine “lifestyle branding” tonight. Was there really a second accident? Or a first, preceding accident? Who knows, it was years ago. We could dismiss it as the delusions and lies of an ailing man, but there is a deeper meaning, beneath the metaphors, that he was struggling to communicate, whether he was even fully aware of it himself, and once it came to me, I lost all doubt. To build a duck, one must become a duck; but to sell a duck, one needs market research, and that is the legacy of his Institute. Such genius. Look at the outpouring of thanks that fills his coffin. Thousands of tiny folded paper ducks. Each a sign of thanks and hope for the companionships he created. You’d think he was drowning in them if he didn’t look so damned peaceful. When I’m silent, listen, beyond these thick church walls, try to hear the joyous chorus of quacking. Ducks, or nothing, he said, and it’s up to us now to use all of that research to extend his dream into places previously unreachable because some last wishes are so obvious you just have to take them to market. Imagine Doris-like companions in thirty-five countries, already translated into twenty different avian varieties for maximum cultural agility. Dear friends, as we say goodbye to O’Malley, let us give a warm, human hello to the new Doris. Listen to her lifelike quack. Look at her pink albino feet flopping – you can’t even hear the hydraulic pumps! You can’t even smell the chemicals. Replicated down to her little half-sleeping brain. There’s a little O’Malley in every one. Go on, touch the tender filaments of her stark white feathers, listen to the padding of her little plastic feet, and peer into her red eyes, those bloody red, red eyes.
