It was easy to keep it all out of his mind. As O’Malley walked away with the albino duck in his arms, it surprised him how easy it was. The squelch of metal. The ripping of brakes. The gasping of wood and the darkness of the power cutting, only the dim light of morning outside by which to see the source of the screaming and pleading, to identify the forms pulled underfoot, or lifted into the window. The girl who had been sitting against his fly, her face obscured by her black hair now pressed to her face by the window. Her flattened lips and the steam of choked breath against the glass. The back door splintered, and O’Malley lunged and slipped and squeezed into the fog. He heard glass break behind him. He felt glass break against his back. He saw a duck, and the duck’s foot looked hurt, and it is this ability to notice things that most people do not that makes him such a titan – a skill that stayed sharp even while his wife complained about the lack of attention paid to her, a quality that requires only that he stay interested in being interested, and it is this – the maintenance of interest – that O’Malley desired most and that compelled him to scoop the duck up and cradle it, accepting its warmth into his arms, admiring the feathers’ whiteness – white as heaven’s starched shirts – and the pink little beak, and the floppy pink feet.
