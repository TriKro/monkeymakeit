Before the accident, we talked often. The founder and I, in board rooms and coffee shops. I was just a junior board member, and he would lecture me on patterns; every morning and evening he’d say, for five-sevenths of the week, millions of people in our city pile into public transportation stops, platforms, corners, awnings, and encasements, sweating in their work shirts in the summer heat or watching their breath puff in the cold or squinting through the impenetrable fog, or else cursing the microclimates and forgotten umbrellas, never speaking to each other, plugged into mobile devices, carrying packs and purses, briefcases and portfolios, lunch and laptop bags, inspecting the signage and billboards and fliers and posters to see if they’ve changed: each mind ready to behold the new wonder, to critique or criticize or ogle, distracted only by flashing digital messages, the sounds of computerized voices instilling them with fear and want and need, listening for the minute-by-minute statuses of their rides into the offices where they may sit in front of their computers – the first fifteen minutes spent checking email for deals, checking blogs for recommendations, then chatting over coffee about what is available in which store that someone saw on a day when everyone else was doing something altogether less interesting, and all of them loving every minute of it, as they should, because without this beautiful dance there would be no economy, no freedom, no choice, no hope.
