“That’s right! Keep your beasts away,” yelled O’Malley, but the man made no indication that he’d heard. O’Malley patted Doris on her downy head. The dogs yanked hard and the man tripped and fell on the curb. O’Malley laughed and shook his head and mumbled “Ah, my fellow man,” and then received a sharp nip on the cheek from Doris. “Sheesh, I’m sorry,” he said, and then repeated, “I’m sorry,” and smiled and stroked her pink little bill. He grabbed a twig from below the bench, then used it to draw in the dirt. Holding the twig above his scrawl, he admired the near-perfect heart with its curvy little tip, and then plunged the twig back into the dirt. When he withdrew it next, a blocky D was in the center. Doris seemed to notice, to wiggle in O’Malley’s arms. He placed Doris on the ground and watched her step across the markings he’d made, erasing the etchings in the dirt. When the D monogram disappeared, it seemed to O’Malley that Doris was negating herself and that this negation was Doris’s little manifesto, an indication of a secret between them alone, one validated without mark or trace. O’Malley nodded to her and did not try to redraw the mark. He sat Doris back on his lap and turned toward the fading sun, staring through the fog until he saw nothing but purple and pink. When the sun was gone, he watched the buildings extrude from the dark blue gradient behind them. The mix of fog and night and human lighting pushed the buildings closer and higher. The contrast was powerful and stirred reverence in O’Malley. It commanded him to look; this arbitrary mixture of architectural intentions from different vantage points and time periods intersecting with a random positioning of natural elements formed this little snapshot here, for him and Doris alone.
