In his office with a doorway but no door, O’Malley typed and clicked at his computer as Doris waddled beneath his desk. He had carried her the twenty-minute walk to his advertising agency just east of the docks. He found some basic instructions online on how to bandage a broken foot, removed his sock from Doris’s wound (though he forgot to put it back on his own foot), and replaced it with gauze and tape from his company supply closet. It was a bit of a challenge. Doris didn’t want to sit still. She wanted to play with the wires under his desk. Her foot didn’t seem to bother her much, but remember that animals are troopers. Once his wrap was complete O’Malley let her play. 

This must have been a trying time for any duck, let alone a traumatized albino, and O’Malley continued his online search for clues that would help him help her. He wanted something that would make him say “Aha!” to himself, and maybe to someone else too, maybe to Doris, or to the board, or even to Andy some other day. O’Malley wanted to know what made Doris tick, and he was a man to seek out the answers. Then his phone rang, and Doris left a mess on the floor. “Poor frightened Doris," said O’Malley. He picked her up and held Doris in his armpit with one hand while his other lifted the phone to the sweet voice of his client Jane.
